  4.1 Motivation
  <a class="anchor" href="#majordesignelements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We designed Kafka to be able to act as a unified platform for handling
all the real-time data feeds <a href="../introduction">a large company might have</a>.
To do this we had to think through a fairly broad set of use cases.</p>
<p>It would have to have high-throughput to support high volume event
streams such as real-time log aggregation.</p>
<p>It would need to deal gracefully with large data backlogs to be able to
support periodic data loads from offline systems.</p>
<p>It also meant the system would have to handle low-latency delivery to
handle more traditional messaging use-cases.</p>
<p>We wanted to support partitioned, distributed, real-time processing of
these feeds to create new, derived feeds. This motivated our
partitioning and consumer model.</p>
<p>Finally in cases where the stream is fed into other data systems for
serving, we knew the system would have to be able to guarantee
fault-tolerance in the presence of machine failures.</p>
<p>Supporting these uses led us to a design with a number of unique
elements, more akin to a database log than a traditional messaging
system. We will outline some elements of the design in the following
sections.</p>

</h3>
<p>Kafka relies heavily on the filesystem for storing and caching messages.
There is a general perception that &quot;disks are slow&quot; which makes people
skeptical that a persistent structure can offer competitive performance.
In fact disks are both much slower and much faster than people expect
depending on how they are used; and a properly designed disk structure
can often be as fast as the network.</p>
<p>The key fact about disk performance is that the throughput of hard
drives has been diverging from the latency of a disk seek for the last
decade. As a result the performance of linear writes on a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-RAID_drive_architectures">JBOD</a>
configuration with six 7200rpm SATA RAID-5 array is about 600MB/sec but
the performance of random writes is only about 100k/sec&mdash;a difference
of over 6000X. These linear reads and writes are the most predictable of
all usage patterns, and are heavily optimized by the operating system. A
modern operating system provides read-ahead and write-behind techniques
that prefetch data in large block multiples and group smaller logical
writes into large physical writes. A further discussion of this issue
can be found in this <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874">ACM Queue article</a>;
they actually find that
<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1563874/jacobs3.jpg">sequential disk access can in some cases be faster than random memory access!</a></p>
<p>To compensate for this performance divergence, modern operating systems
have become increasingly aggressive in their use of main memory for disk
caching. A modern OS will happily divert <em>all</em> free memory to disk
caching with little performance penalty when the memory is reclaimed.
All disk reads and writes will go through this unified cache. This
feature cannot easily be turned off without using direct I/O, so even if
a process maintains an in-process cache of the data, this data will
likely be duplicated in OS pagecache, effectively storing everything
twice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are building on top of the JVM, and anyone who has spent
any time with Java memory usage knows two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The memory overhead of objects is very high, often doubling the size
of the data stored (or worse).</li>
<li>Java garbage collection becomes increasingly fiddly and slow as the
in-heap data increases.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result of these factors using the filesystem and relying on
pagecache is superior to maintaining an in-memory cache or other
structure&mdash;we at least double the available cache by having automatic
access to all free memory, and likely double again by storing a compact
byte structure rather than individual objects. Doing so will result in a
cache of up to 28-30GB on a 32GB machine without GC penalties.
Furthermore, this cache will stay warm even if the service is restarted,
whereas the in-process cache will need to be rebuilt in memory (which
for a 10GB cache may take 10 minutes) or else it will need to start with
a completely cold cache (which likely means terrible initial
performance). This also greatly simplifies the code as all logic for
maintaining coherency between the cache and filesystem is now in the OS,
which tends to do so more efficiently and more correctly than one-off
in-process attempts. If your disk usage favors linear reads then
read-ahead is effectively pre-populating this cache with useful data on
each disk read.</p>
<p>This suggests a design which is very simple: rather than maintain as
much as possible in-memory and flush it all out to the filesystem in a
panic when we run out of space, we invert that. All data is immediately
written to a persistent log on the filesystem without necessarily
flushing to disk. In effect this just means that it is transferred into
the kernel's pagecache.</p>
<p>This style of pagecache-centric design is described in an
<a href="http://varnish-cache.org/wiki/ArchitectNotes">article</a> on the design of
Varnish here (along with a healthy dose of arrogance).</p>
<h3 id="design_constanttime">
  Constant Time Suffices
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_constanttime">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The persistent data structure used in messaging systems are often a
per-consumer queue with an associated BTree or other general-purpose
random access data structures to maintain metadata about messages.
BTrees are the most versatile data structure available, and make it
possible to support a wide variety of transactional and
non-transactional semantics in the messaging system. They do come with a
fairly high cost, though: Btree operations are O(log N). Normally O(log
N) is considered essentially equivalent to constant time, but this is
not true for disk operations. Disk seeks come at 10 ms a pop, and each
disk can do only one seek at a time so parallelism is limited. Hence
even a handful of disk seeks leads to very high overhead. Since storage
systems mix very fast cached operations with very slow physical disk
operations, the observed performance of tree structures is often
superlinear as data increases with fixed cache--i.e. doubling your data
makes things much worse than twice as slow.</p>
<p>Intuitively a persistent queue could be built on simple reads and
appends to files as is commonly the case with logging solutions. This
structure has the advantage that all operations are O(1) and reads do
not block writes or each other. This has obvious performance advantages
since the performance is completely decoupled from the data size&mdash;one
server can now take full advantage of a number of cheap, low-rotational
speed 1+TB SATA drives. Though they have poor seek performance, these
drives have acceptable performance for large reads and writes and come
at 1/3 the price and 3x the capacity.</p>
<p>Having access to virtually unlimited disk space without any performance
penalty means that we can provide some features not usually found in a
messaging system. For example, in Kafka, instead of attempting to delete
messages as soon as they are consumed, we can retain messages for a
relatively long period (say a week). This leads to a great deal of
flexibility for consumers, as we will describe.</p>
<h2 id="maximizingefficiency">
  4.3 Efficiency
  <a class="anchor" href="#maximizingefficiency">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We have put significant effort into efficiency. One of our primary use
cases is handling web activity data, which is very high volume: each
page view may generate dozens of writes. Furthermore, we assume each
message published is read by at least one consumer (often many), hence
we strive to make consumption as cheap as possible.</p>
<p>We have also found, from experience building and running a number of
similar systems, that efficiency is a key to effective multi-tenant
operations. If the downstream infrastructure service can easily become a
bottleneck due to a small bump in usage by the application, such small
changes will often create problems. By being very fast we help ensure
that the application will tip-over under load before the infrastructure.
This is particularly important when trying to run a centralized service
that supports dozens or hundreds of applications on a centralized
cluster as changes in usage patterns are a near-daily occurrence.</p>
<p>We discussed disk efficiency in the previous section. Once poor disk
access patterns have been eliminated, there are two common causes of
inefficiency in this type of system: too many small I/O operations, and
excessive byte copying.</p>
<p>The small I/O problem happens both between the client and the server and
in the server's own persistent operations.</p>
<p>To avoid this, our protocol is built around a &quot;message set&quot;
abstraction that naturally groups messages together. This allows network
requests to group messages together and amortize the overhead of the
network roundtrip rather than sending a single message at a time. The
server in turn appends chunks of messages to its log in one go, and the
consumer fetches large linear chunks at a time.</p>
<p>This simple optimization produces orders of magnitude speed up. Batching
leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations,
contiguous memory blocks, and so on, all of which allows Kafka to turn a
bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes that flow to
the consumers.</p>
<p>The other inefficiency is in byte copying. At low message rates this is
not an issue, but under load the impact is significant. To avoid this we
employ a standardized binary message format that is shared by the
producer, the broker, and the consumer (so data chunks can be
transferred without modification between them).</p>
<p>The message log maintained by the broker is itself just a directory of
files, each populated by a sequence of message sets that have been
written to disk in the same format used by the producer and consumer.
Maintaining this common format allows optimization of the most important
operation: network transfer of persistent log chunks. Modern unix
operating systems offer a highly optimized code path for transferring
data out of pagecache to a socket; in Linux this is done with the
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile system call</a>.</p>
<p>To understand the impact of sendfile, it is important to understand the
common data path for transfer of data from file to socket:</p>
<ol>
<li>The operating system reads data from the disk into pagecache in
kernel space</li>
<li>The application reads the data from kernel space into a user-space
buffer</li>
<li>The application writes the data back into kernel space into a socket
buffer</li>
<li>The operating system copies the data from the socket buffer to the
NIC buffer where it is sent over the network</li>
</ol>
<p>This is clearly inefficient, there are four copies and two system calls.
Using sendfile, this re-copying is avoided by allowing the OS to send
the data from pagecache to the network directly. So in this optimized
path, only the final copy to the NIC buffer is needed.</p>
<p>We expect a common use case to be multiple consumers on a topic. Using
the zero-copy optimization above, data is copied into pagecache exactly
once and reused on each consumption instead of being stored in memory
and copied out to user-space every time it is read. This allows messages
to be consumed at a rate that approaches the limit of the network
connection.</p>
<p>This combination of pagecache and sendfile means that on a Kafka cluster
where the consumers are mostly caught up you will see no read activity
on the disks whatsoever as they will be serving data entirely from
cache.</p>
<p>TLS/SSL libraries operate at the user space (in-kernel <code>SSL_sendfile</code> is
currently not supported by Kafka). Due to this restriction, <code>sendfile</code>
is not used when SSL is enabled. For enabling SSL configuration, refer
to <code>security.protocol</code> and <code>security.inter.broker.protocol</code></p>

<h3 id="design_compression">
  End-to-end Batch Compression
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_compression">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In some cases the bottleneck is actually not CPU or disk but network
bandwidth. This is particularly true for a data pipeline that needs to
send messages between data centers over a wide-area network. Of course,
the user can always compress its messages one at a time without any
support needed from Kafka, but this can lead to very poor compression
ratios as much of the redundancy is due to repetition between messages
of the same type (e.g. field names in JSON or user agents in web logs or
common string values). Efficient compression requires compressing
multiple messages together rather than compressing each message
individually.</p>
<p>Kafka supports this with an efficient batching format. A batch of
messages can be clumped together compressed and sent to the server in
this form. This batch of messages will be written in compressed form and
will remain compressed in the log and will only be decompressed by the
consumer.</p>
<p>Kafka supports GZIP, Snappy, LZ4 and ZStandard compression protocols.

<p>The producer sends data directly to the broker that is the leader for
the partition without any intervening routing tier. To help the producer
do this all Kafka nodes can answer a request for metadata about which
servers are alive and where the leaders for the partitions of a topic
are at any given time to allow the producer to appropriately direct its
requests.</p>
<p>The client controls which partition it publishes messages to. This can
be done at random, implementing a kind of random load balancing, or it
can be done by some semantic partitioning function. We expose the
interface for semantic partitioning by allowing the user to specify a
key to partition by and using this to hash to a partition (there is also
an option to override the partition function if need be). For example if
the key chosen was a user id then all data for a given user would be
sent to the same partition. This in turn will allow consumers to make
locality assumptions about their consumption. This style of partitioning
is explicitly designed to allow locality-sensitive processing in
consumers.</p>

<p>Batching is one of the big drivers of efficiency, and to enable batching
the Kafka producer will attempt to accumulate data in memory and to send
out larger batches in a single request. The batching can be configured
to accumulate no more than a fixed number of messages and to wait no
longer than some fixed latency bound (say 64k or 10 ms). This allows the
accumulation of more bytes to send, and few larger I/O operations on the
servers. This buffering is configurable and gives a mechanism to trade
off a small amount of additional latency for better throughput.</p>

<h2 id="theconsumer">
  4.5 The Consumer
  <a class="anchor" href="#theconsumer">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The Kafka consumer works by issuing &quot;fetch&quot; requests to the brokers
leading the partitions it wants to consume. The consumer specifies its
offset in the log with each request and receives back a chunk of log
beginning from that position. The consumer thus has significant control
over this position and can rewind it to re-consume data if need be.</p>
<h3 id="design_pull">
  Push vs. pull
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_pull">#</a>
</h3>
<p>An initial question we considered is whether consumers should pull data
from brokers or brokers should push data to the consumer. In this
respect Kafka follows a more traditional design, shared by most
messaging systems, where data is pushed to the broker from the producer
and pulled from the broker by the consumer. Some logging-centric
systems, such as <a href="http://github.com/facebook/scribe">Scribe</a>
and <a href="http://flume.apache.org/">Apache Flume</a>, follow a very different push-based
path where data is pushed downstream. There are pros and cons to both
approaches. However, a push-based system has difficulty dealing with
diverse consumers as the broker controls the rate at which data is
transferred. The goal is generally for the consumer to be able to
consume at the maximum possible rate; unfortunately, in a push system
this means the consumer tends to be overwhelmed when its rate of
consumption falls below the rate of production (a denial of service
attack, in essence). A pull-based system has the nicer property that the
consumer simply falls behind and catches up when it can. This can be
mitigated with some kind of backoff protocol by which the consumer can
indicate it is overwhelmed, but getting the rate of transfer to fully
utilize (but never over-utilize) the consumer is trickier than it seems.
Previous attempts at building systems in this fashion led us to go with
a more traditional pull model.</p>
<p>Another advantage of a pull-based system is that it lends itself to
aggressive batching of data sent to the consumer. A push-based system
must choose to either send a request immediately or accumulate more data
and then send it later without knowledge of whether the downstream
consumer will be able to immediately process it. If tuned for low
latency, this will result in sending a single message at a time only for
the transfer to end up being buffered anyway, which is wasteful. A
pull-based design fixes this as the consumer always pulls all available
messages after its current position in the log (or up to some
configurable max size). So one gets optimal batching without introducing
unnecessary latency.</p>
<p>The deficiency of a naive pull-based system is that if the broker has no
data the consumer may end up polling in a tight loop, effectively
busy-waiting for data to arrive. To avoid this we have parameters in our
pull request that allow the consumer request to block in a &quot;long poll&quot;
waiting until data arrives (and optionally waiting until a given number
of bytes is available to ensure large transfer sizes).</p>
<p>You could imagine other possible designs which would be only pull,
end-to-end. The producer would locally write to a local log, and brokers
would pull from that with consumers pulling from them. A similar type of
&quot;store-and-forward&quot; producer is often proposed. This is intriguing but
we felt not very suitable for our target use cases which have thousands
of producers. Our experience running persistent data systems at scale
led us to feel that involving thousands of disks in the system across
many applications would not actually make things more reliable and would
be a nightmare to operate. And in practice we have found that we can run
a pipeline with strong SLAs at large scale without a need for producer
persistence.</p>
<h3 id="design_consumerposition">
  Consumer Position
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_consumerposition">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Keeping track of <em>what</em> has been consumed is, surprisingly, one of the
key performance points of a messaging system.</p>
<p>Most messaging systems keep metadata about what messages have been
consumed on the broker. That is, as a message is handed out to a
consumer, the broker either records that fact locally immediately or it
may wait for acknowledgement from the consumer. This is a fairly
intuitive choice, and indeed for a single machine server it is not clear
where else this state could go. Since the data structures used for
storage in many messaging systems scale poorly, this is also a pragmatic
choice--since the broker knows what is consumed it can immediately
delete it, keeping the data size small.</p>
<p>What is perhaps not obvious is that getting the broker and consumer to
come into agreement about what has been consumed is not a trivial
problem. If the broker records a message as <strong>consumed</strong> immediately
every time it is handed out over the network, then if the consumer fails
to process the message (say because it crashes or the request times out
or whatever) that message will be lost. To solve this problem, many
messaging systems add an acknowledgement feature which means that
messages are only marked as <strong>sent</strong> not <strong>consumed</strong> when they are
sent; the broker waits for a specific acknowledgement from the consumer
to record the message as <strong>consumed</strong>. This strategy fixes the problem
of losing messages, but creates new problems. First of all, if the
consumer processes the message but fails before it can send an
acknowledgement then the message will be consumed twice. The second
problem is around performance, now the broker must keep multiple states
about every single message (first to lock it so it is not given out a
second time, and then to mark it as permanently consumed so that it can
be removed). Tricky problems must be dealt with, like what to do with
messages that are sent but never acknowledged.</p>
<p>Kafka handles this differently. Our topic is divided into a set of
totally ordered partitions, each of which is consumed by exactly one
consumer within each subscribing consumer group at any given time. This
means that the position of a consumer in each partition is just a single
integer, the offset of the next message to consume. This makes the state
about what has been consumed very small, just one number for each
partition. This state can be periodically checkpointed. This makes the
equivalent of message acknowledgements very cheap.</p>
<p>There is a side benefit of this decision. A consumer can deliberately
<em>rewind</em> back to an old offset and re-consume data. This violates the
common contract of a queue, but turns out to be an essential feature for
many consumers. For example, if the consumer code has a bug and is
discovered after some messages are consumed, the consumer can re-consume
those messages once the bug is fixed.</p>
<h3 id="design_offlineload">
  Offline Data Load
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_offlineload">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scalable persistence allows for the possibility of consumers that only
periodically consume such as batch data loads that periodically
bulk-load data into an offline system such as Hadoop or a relational
data warehouse.</p>
<p>In the case of Hadoop we parallelize the data load by splitting the load
over individual map tasks, one for each node/topic/partition
combination, allowing full parallelism in the loading. Hadoop provides
the task management, and tasks which fail can restart without danger of
duplicate data&mdash;they simply restart from their original position.</p>
<h3 id="static_membership">
  Static Membership
  <a class="anchor" href="#static_membership">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Static membership aims to improve the availability of stream
applications, consumer groups and other applications built on top of the
group rebalance protocol. The rebalance protocol relies on the group
coordinator to allocate entity ids to group members. These generated ids
are ephemeral and will change when members restart and rejoin. For
consumer based apps, this &quot;dynamic membership&quot; can cause a large
percentage of tasks re-assigned to different instances during
administrative operations such as code deploys, configuration updates
and periodic restarts. For large state applications, shuffled tasks need
a long time to recover their local states before processing and cause
applications to be partially or entirely unavailable. Motivated by this
observation, Kafka&rsquo;s group management protocol allows group members to
provide persistent entity ids. Group membership remains unchanged based
on those ids, thus no rebalance will be triggered.</p>
<p>If you want to use static membership,</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade both broker cluster and client apps to 2.3 or beyond, and
also make sure the upgraded brokers are using
<code>inter.broker.protocol.version</code> of 2.3 or beyond as well.</li>
<li>Set the config <code>ConsumerConfig#GROUP_INSTANCE_ID_CONFIG</code> to a unique
value for each consumer instance under one group.</li>
<li>For Kafka Streams applications, it is sufficient to set a unique
<code>ConsumerConfig#GROUP_INSTANCE_ID_CONFIG</code> per KafkaStreams instance,
independent of the number of used threads for an instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your broker is on an older version than 2.3, but you choose to set
<code>ConsumerConfig#GROUP_INSTANCE_ID_CONFIG</code> on the client side, the
application will detect the broker version and then throws an
UnsupportedException. If you accidentally configure duplicate ids for
different instances, a fencing mechanism on broker side will inform your
duplicate client to shutdown immediately by triggering a
<code>org.apache.kafka.common.errors.FencedInstanceIdException</code>. For more
details, see

<h2 id="semantics">
  4.6 Message Delivery Semantics
  <a class="anchor" href="#semantics">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Now that we understand a little about how producers and consumers work,
let's discuss the semantic guarantees Kafka provides between producer
and consumer. Clearly there are multiple possible message delivery
guarantees that could be provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>At most once</em>&mdash;Messages may be lost but are never redelivered.</li>
<li><em>At least once</em>&mdash;Messages are never lost but may be redelivered.</li>
<li><em>Exactly once</em>&mdash;this is what people actually want, each message is
delivered once and only once.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that this breaks down into two problems: the
durability guarantees for publishing a message and the guarantees when
consuming a message.</p>
<p>Many systems claim to provide &quot;exactly once&quot; delivery semantics, but
it is important to read the fine print, most of these claims are
misleading (i.e. they don't translate to the case where consumers or
producers can fail, cases where there are multiple consumer processes,
or cases where data written to disk can be lost).</p>
<p>Kafka's semantics are straight-forward. When publishing a message we
have a notion of the message being &quot;committed&quot; to the log. Once a
published message is committed it will not be lost as long as one broker
that replicates the partition to which this message was written remains
&quot;alive&quot;. The definition of committed message, alive partition as well
as a description of which types of failures we attempt to handle will be
described in more detail in the next section. For now let's assume a
perfect, lossless broker and try to understand the guarantees to the
producer and consumer. If a producer attempts to publish a message and
experiences a network error it cannot be sure if this error happened
before or after the message was committed. This is similar to the
semantics of inserting into a database table with an autogenerated key.</p>
<p>Prior to 0.11.0.0, if a producer failed to receive a response indicating
that a message was committed, it had little choice but to resend the
message. This provides at-least-once delivery semantics since the
message may be written to the log again during resending if the original
request had in fact succeeded. Since 0.11.0.0, the Kafka producer also
supports an idempotent delivery option which guarantees that resending
will not result in duplicate entries in the log. To achieve this, the
broker assigns each producer an ID and deduplicates messages using a
sequence number that is sent by the producer along with every message.
Also beginning with 0.11.0.0, the producer supports the ability to send
messages to multiple topic partitions using transaction-like semantics:
i.e. either all messages are successfully written or none of them are.
The main use case for this is exactly-once processing between Kafka
topics (described below).</p>
<p>Not all use cases require such strong guarantees. For uses which are
latency sensitive we allow the producer to specify the durability level
it desires. If the producer specifies that it wants to wait on the
message being committed this can take on the order of 10 ms. However the
producer can also specify that it wants to perform the send completely
asynchronously or that it wants to wait only until the leader (but not
necessarily the followers) have the message.</p>
<p>Now let's describe the semantics from the point-of-view of the
consumer. All replicas have the exact same log with the same offsets.
The consumer controls its position in this log. If the consumer never
crashed it could just store this position in memory, but if the consumer
fails and we want this topic partition to be taken over by another
process the new process will need to choose an appropriate position from
which to start processing. Let's say the consumer reads some messages
-- it has several options for processing the messages and updating its
position.</p>
<ol>
<li>It can read the messages, then save its position in the log, and
finally process the messages. In this case there is a possibility
that the consumer process crashes after saving its position but
before saving the output of its message processing. In this case the
process that took over processing would start at the saved position
even though a few messages prior to that position had not been
processed. This corresponds to &quot;at-most-once&quot; semantics as in the
case of a consumer failure messages may not be processed.</li>
<li>It can read the messages, process the messages, and finally save its
position. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer
process crashes after processing messages but before saving its
position. In this case when the new process takes over the first few
messages it receives will already have been processed. This
corresponds to the &quot;at-least-once&quot; semantics in the case of
consumer failure. In many cases messages have a primary key and so
the updates are idempotent (receiving the same message twice just
overwrites a record with another copy of itself).</li>
</ol>
<p>So what about exactly once semantics (i.e. the thing you actually want)?
When consuming from a Kafka topic and producing to another topic (as in
a <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>
application), we can leverage the new transactional producer
capabilities in 0.11.0.0 that were mentioned above. The consumer's
position is stored as a message in a topic, so we can write the offset
to Kafka in the same transaction as the output topics receiving the
processed data. If the transaction is aborted, the consumer's position
will revert to its old value and the produced data on the output topics
will not be visible to other consumers, depending on their &quot;isolation
level.&quot; In the default &quot;read_uncommitted&quot; isolation level, all
messages are visible to consumers even if they were part of an aborted
transaction, but in &quot;read_committed,&quot; the consumer will only return
messages from transactions which were committed (and any messages which
were not part of a transaction).</p>
<p>When writing to an external system, the limitation is in the need to
coordinate the consumer's position with what is actually stored as
output. The classic way of achieving this would be to introduce a
two-phase commit between the storage of the consumer position and the
storage of the consumers output. But this can be handled more simply and
generally by letting the consumer store its offset in the same place as
its output. This is better because many of the output systems a consumer
might want to write to will not support a two-phase commit. As an
example of this, consider a
<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a> connector
which populates data in HDFS along with the offsets of the data it reads
so that it is guaranteed that either data and offsets are both updated
or neither is. We follow similar patterns for many other data systems
which require these stronger semantics and for which the messages do not
have a primary key to allow for deduplication.</p>
<p>So effectively Kafka supports exactly-once delivery in
<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>, and the
transactional producer/consumer can be used generally to provide
exactly-once delivery when transferring and processing data between
Kafka topics. Exactly-once delivery for other destination systems
generally requires cooperation with such systems, but Kafka provides the
offset which makes implementing this feasible (see also
<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a>). Otherwise,
Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery by default, and allows the user
to implement at-most-once delivery by disabling retries on the producer
and committing offsets in the consumer prior to processing a batch of
messages.</p>
<h2 id="replication">
  4.7 Replication
  <a class="anchor" href="#replication">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Kafka replicates the log for each topic's partitions across a
configurable number of servers (you can set this replication factor on a
topic-by-topic basis). This allows automatic failover to these replicas
when a server in the cluster fails so messages remain available in the
presence of failures.</p>
<p>Other messaging systems provide some replication-related features, but,
in our (totally biased) opinion, this appears to be a tacked-on thing,
not heavily used, and with large downsides: replicas are inactive,
throughput is heavily impacted, it requires fiddly manual configuration,
etc. Kafka is meant to be used with replication by default&mdash;in fact we
implement un-replicated topics as replicated topics where the
replication factor is one.</p>
<p>The unit of replication is the topic partition. Under non-failure
conditions, each partition in Kafka has a single leader and zero or more
followers. The total number of replicas including the leader constitute
the replication factor. All writes go to the leader of the partition,
and reads can go to the leader or the followers of the partition.
Typically, there are many more partitions than brokers and the leaders
are evenly distributed among brokers. The logs on the followers are
identical to the leader's log&mdash;all have the same offsets and messages
in the same order (though, of course, at any given time the leader may
have a few as-yet unreplicated messages at the end of its log).</p>
<p>Followers consume messages from the leader just as a normal Kafka
consumer would and apply them to their own log. Having the followers
pull from the leader has the nice property of allowing the follower to
naturally batch together log entries they are applying to their log.</p>
<p>As with most distributed systems, automatically handling failures
requires a precise definition of what it means for a node to be
&quot;alive.&quot; In Kafka, a special node known as the &quot;controller&quot; is
responsible for managing the registration of brokers in the cluster.
Broker liveness has two conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brokers must maintain an active session with the controller in order
to receive regular metadata updates.</li>
<li>Brokers acting as followers must replicate the writes from the
leader and not fall &quot;too far&quot; behind.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is meant by an &quot;active session&quot; depends on the cluster
configuration. For KRaft clusters, an active session is maintained by
sending periodic heartbeats to the controller. If the controller fails
to receive a heartbeat before the timeout configured by
<code>broker.session.timeout.ms</code> expires, then the node is considered
offline.</p>
<p>For clusters using Zookeeper, liveness is determined indirectly through
the existence of an ephemeral node which is created by the broker on
initialization of its Zookeeper session. If the broker loses its session
after failing to send heartbeats to Zookeeper before expiration of
<code>zookeeper.session.timeout.ms</code>, then the node gets deleted. The
controller would then notice the node deletion through a Zookeeper watch
and mark the broker offline.</p>
<p>We refer to nodes satisfying these two conditions as being &quot;in sync&quot;
to avoid the vagueness of &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;failed&quot;. The leader keeps
track of the set of &quot;in sync&quot; replicas, which is known as the ISR. If
either of these conditions fail to be satisified, then the broker will
be removed from the ISR. For example, if a follower dies, then the
controller will notice the failure through the loss of its session, and
will remove the broker from the ISR. On the other hand, if the follower
lags too far behind the leader but still has an active session, then the
leader can also remove it from the ISR. The determination of lagging
replicas is controlled through the <code>replica.lag.time.max.ms</code>
configuration. Replicas that cannot catch up to the end of the log on
the leader within the max time set by this configuration are removed
from the ISR.</p>
<p>In distributed systems terminology we only attempt to handle a
&quot;fail/recover&quot; model of failures where nodes suddenly cease working
and then later recover (perhaps without knowing that they have died).
Kafka does not handle so-called &quot;Byzantine&quot; failures in which nodes
produce arbitrary or malicious responses (perhaps due to bugs or foul
play).</p>
<p>We can now more precisely define that a message is considered committed
when all replicas in the ISR for that partition have applied it to their
log. Only committed messages are ever given out to the consumer. This
means that the consumer need not worry about potentially seeing a
message that could be lost if the leader fails. Producers, on the other
hand, have the option of either waiting for the message to be committed
or not, depending on their preference for tradeoff between latency and
durability. This preference is controlled by the acks setting that the
producer uses. Note that topics have a setting for the &quot;minimum
number&quot; of in-sync replicas that is checked when the producer requests
acknowledgment that a message has been written to the full set of
in-sync replicas. If a less stringent acknowledgement is requested by
the producer, then the message can be committed, and consumed, even if
the number of in-sync replicas is lower than the minimum (e.g. it can be
as low as just the leader).</p>
<p>The guarantee that Kafka offers is that a committed message will not be
lost, as long as there is at least one in sync replica alive, at all
times.</p>
<p>Kafka will remain available in the presence of node failures after a
short fail-over period, but may not remain available in the presence of
network partitions.</p>

  Replicated Logs: Quorums, ISRs, and State Machines (Oh my!)
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_replicatedlog">#</a>
</h3>
<p>At its heart a Kafka partition is a replicated log. The replicated log
is one of the most basic primitives in distributed data systems, and
there are many approaches for implementing one. A replicated log can be
used by other systems as a primitive for implementing other distributed
systems in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication">state-machine style</a>.</p>
<p>A replicated log models the process of coming into consensus on the
order of a series of values (generally numbering the log entries 0, 1,
2, ...). There are many ways to implement this, but the simplest and
fastest is with a leader who chooses the ordering of values provided to
it. As long as the leader remains alive, all followers need to only copy
the values and ordering the leader chooses.</p>
<p>Of course if leaders didn't fail we wouldn't need followers! When the
leader does die we need to choose a new leader from among the followers.
But followers themselves may fall behind or crash so we must ensure we
choose an up-to-date follower. The fundamental guarantee a log
replication algorithm must provide is that if we tell the client a
message is committed, and the leader fails, the new leader we elect must
also have that message. This yields a tradeoff: if the leader waits for
more followers to acknowledge a message before declaring it committed
then there will be more potentially electable leaders.</p>
<p>If you choose the number of acknowledgements required and the number of
logs that must be compared to elect a leader such that there is
guaranteed to be an overlap, then this is called a Quorum.</p>
<p>A common approach to this tradeoff is to use a majority vote for both
the commit decision and the leader election. This is not what Kafka
does, but let's explore it anyway to understand the tradeoffs. Let's
say we have 2<em>f</em>+1 replicas. If <em>f</em>+1 replicas must receive a message
prior to a commit being declared by the leader, and if we elect a new
leader by electing the follower with the most complete log from at least
<em>f</em>+1 replicas, then, with no more than <em>f</em> failures, the leader is
guaranteed to have all committed messages. This is because among any
<em>f</em>+1 replicas, there must be at least one replica that contains all
committed messages. That replica's log will be the most complete and
therefore will be selected as the new leader. There are many remaining
details that each algorithm must handle (such as precisely defined what
makes a log more complete, ensuring log consistency during leader
failure or changing the set of servers in the replica set) but we will
ignore these for now.</p>
<p>This majority vote approach has a very nice property: the latency is
dependent on only the fastest servers. That is, if the replication
factor is three, the latency is determined by the faster follower not
the slower one.</p>
<p>There are a rich variety of algorithms in this family including
ZooKeeper's
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140602093727/http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs347/reading/zab.pdf">Zab</a>,
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-ongaro.pdf">Raft</a>,
and <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf">Viewstamped Replication</a>.
The most similar academic publication we are aware of to Kafka's actual implementation is
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=66814">PacificA</a>
from Microsoft.</p>
<p>The downside of majority vote is that it doesn't take many failures to
leave you with no electable leaders. To tolerate one failure requires
three copies of the data, and to tolerate two failures requires five
copies of the data. In our experience having only enough redundancy to
tolerate a single failure is not enough for a practical system, but
doing every write five times, with 5x the disk space requirements and
1/5th the throughput, is not very practical for large volume data
problems. This is likely why quorum algorithms more commonly appear for
shared cluster configuration such as ZooKeeper but are less common for
primary data storage. For example in HDFS the namenode's
high-availability feature is built on a <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/quorum-based-journaling-in-cdh4-1">majority-vote-based
journal</a>,
but this more expensive approach is not used for the data itself.</p>
<p>Kafka takes a slightly different approach to choosing its quorum set.
Instead of majority vote, Kafka dynamically maintains a set of in-sync
replicas (ISR) that are caught-up to the leader. Only members of this
set are eligible for election as leader. A write to a Kafka partition is
not considered committed until <em>all</em> in-sync replicas have received the
write. This ISR set is persisted in the cluster metadata whenever it
changes. Because of this, any replica in the ISR is eligible to be
elected leader. This is an important factor for Kafka's usage model
where there are many partitions and ensuring leadership balance is
important. With this ISR model and <em>f+1</em> replicas, a Kafka topic can
tolerate <em>f</em> failures without losing committed messages.</p>
<p>For most use cases we hope to handle, we think this tradeoff is a
reasonable one. In practice, to tolerate <em>f</em> failures, both the majority
vote and the ISR approach will wait for the same number of replicas to
acknowledge before committing a message (e.g. to survive one failure a
majority quorum needs three replicas and one acknowledgement and the ISR
approach requires two replicas and one acknowledgement). The ability to
commit without the slowest servers is an advantage of the majority vote
approach. However, we think it is ameliorated by allowing the client to
choose whether they block on the message commit or not, and the
additional throughput and disk space due to the lower required
replication factor is worth it.</p>
<p>Another important design distinction is that Kafka does not require that
crashed nodes recover with all their data intact. It is not uncommon for
replication algorithms in this space to depend on the existence of
&quot;stable storage&quot; that cannot be lost in any failure-recovery scenario
without potential consistency violations. There are two primary problems
with this assumption. First, disk errors are the most common problem we
observe in real operation of persistent data systems and they often do
not leave data intact. Secondly, even if this were not a problem, we do
not want to require the use of fsync on every write for our consistency
guarantees as this can reduce performance by two to three orders of
magnitude. Our protocol for allowing a replica to rejoin the ISR ensures
that before rejoining, it must fully re-sync again even if it lost
unflushed data in its crash.</p>
<h3 id="design_uncleanleader">
  Unclean leader election: What if they all die?
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_uncleanleader">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Note that Kafka's guarantee with respect to data loss is predicated on
at least one replica remaining in sync. If all the nodes replicating a
partition die, this guarantee no longer holds.</p>
<p>However a practical system needs to do something reasonable when all the
replicas die. If you are unlucky enough to have this occur, it is
important to consider what will happen. There are two behaviors that
could be implemented:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for a replica in the ISR to come back to life and choose this
replica as the leader (hopefully it still has all its data).</li>
<li>Choose the first replica (not necessarily in the ISR) that comes
back to life as the leader.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a simple tradeoff between availability and consistency. If we
wait for replicas in the ISR, then we will remain unavailable as long as
those replicas are down. If such replicas were destroyed or their data
was lost, then we are permanently down. If, on the other hand, a
non-in-sync replica comes back to life and we allow it to become leader,
then its log becomes the source of truth even though it is not
guaranteed to have every committed message. By default from version
0.11.0.0, Kafka chooses the first strategy and favor waiting for a
consistent replica. This behavior can be changed using configuration
property unclean.leader.election.enable, to support use cases where
uptime is preferable to consistency.</p>
<p>This dilemma is not specific to Kafka. It exists in any quorum-based
scheme. For example in a majority voting scheme, if a majority of
servers suffer a permanent failure, then you must either choose to lose
100% of your data or violate consistency by taking what remains on an
existing server as your new source of truth.</p>
<h3 id="design_ha">
  Availability and Durability Guarantees
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_ha">#</a>
</h3>
<p>When writing to Kafka, producers can choose whether they wait for the
message to be acknowledged by 0,1 or all (-1) replicas. Note that
&quot;acknowledgement by all replicas&quot; does not guarantee that the full set
of assigned replicas have received the message. By default, when
acks=all, acknowledgement happens as soon as all the current in-sync
replicas have received the message. For example, if a topic is
configured with only two replicas and one fails (i.e., only one in sync
replica remains), then writes that specify acks=all will succeed.
However, these writes could be lost if the remaining replica also fails.
Although this ensures maximum availability of the partition, this
behavior may be undesirable to some users who prefer durability over
availability. Therefore, we provide two topic-level configurations that
can be used to prefer message durability over availability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable unclean leader election - if all replicas become
unavailable, then the partition will remain unavailable until the
most recent leader becomes available again. This effectively prefers
unavailability over the risk of message loss. See the previous
section on Unclean Leader Election for clarification.</li>
<li>Specify a minimum ISR size - the partition will only accept writes
if the size of the ISR is above a certain minimum, in order to
prevent the loss of messages that were written to just a single
replica, which subsequently becomes unavailable. This setting only
takes effect if the producer uses acks=all and guarantees that the
message will be acknowledged by at least this many in-sync replicas.
This setting offers a trade-off between consistency and
availability. A higher setting for minimum ISR size guarantees
better consistency since the message is guaranteed to be written to
more replicas which reduces the probability that it will be lost.
However, it reduces availability since the partition will be
unavailable for writes if the number of in-sync replicas drops below
the minimum threshold.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="design_replicamanagment">
  Replica Management
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_replicamanagment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The above discussion on replicated logs really covers only a single log,
i.e. one topic partition. However a Kafka cluster will manage hundreds
or thousands of these partitions. We attempt to balance partitions
within a cluster in a round-robin fashion to avoid clustering all
partitions for high-volume topics on a small number of nodes. Likewise
we try to balance leadership so that each node is the leader for a
proportional share of its partitions.</p>
<p>It is also important to optimize the leadership election process as that
is the critical window of unavailability. A naive implementation of
leader election would end up running an election per partition for all
partitions a node hosted when that node failed. As discussed above in
the section on <a href="#replication">replication</a>, Kafka clusters have a
special role known as the &quot;controller&quot; which is responsible for
managing the registration of brokers. If the controller detects the
failure of a broker, it is responsible for electing one of the remaining
members of the ISR to serve as the new leader. The result is that we are
able to batch together many of the required leadership change
notifications which makes the election process far cheaper and faster
for a large number of partitions. If the controller itself fails, then
another controller will be elected.</p>
<h2 id="compaction">
  4.8 Log Compaction
  <a class="anchor" href="#compaction">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Log compaction ensures that Kafka will always retain at least the last
known value for each message key within the log of data for a single
topic partition. It addresses use cases and scenarios such as restoring
state after application crashes or system failure, or reloading caches
after application restarts during operational maintenance. Let's dive
into these use cases in more detail and then describe how compaction
works.</p>
<p>So far we have described only the simpler approach to data retention
where old log data is discarded after a fixed period of time or when the
log reaches some predetermined size. This works well for temporal event
data such as logging where each record stands alone. However an
important class of data streams are the log of changes to keyed, mutable
data (for example, the changes to a database table).</p>
<p>Let's discuss a concrete example of such a stream. Say we have a topic
containing user email addresses; every time a user updates their email
address we send a message to this topic using their user id as the
primary key. Now say we send the following messages over some time
period for a user with id 123, each message corresponding to a change in
email address (messages for other ids are omitted):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-line-numbers" data-lang="line-numbers">123 =&gt; bill@microsoft.com

123 =&gt; bill@gatesfoundation.org
        .
        .
        .
123 =&gt; bill@gmail.com
</code></pre><p>Log compaction gives us a more granular retention mechanism so that we
are guaranteed to retain at least the last update for each primary key
(e.g. <code>bill@gmail.com</code>). By doing this we guarantee that the log
contains a full snapshot of the final value for every key not just keys
that changed recently. This means downstream consumers can restore their
own state off this topic without us having to retain a complete log of
all changes.</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at a few use cases where this is useful, then
we'll see how it can be used.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Database change subscription</em>. It is often necessary to have a data
set in multiple data systems, and often one of these systems is a
database of some kind (either a RDBMS or perhaps a new-fangled
key-value store). For example you might have a database, a cache, a
search cluster, and a Hadoop cluster. Each change to the database
will need to be reflected in the cache, the search cluster, and
eventually in Hadoop. In the case that one is only handling the
real-time updates you only need recent log. But if you want to be
able to reload the cache or restore a failed search node you may
need a complete data set.</li>
<li><em>Event sourcing</em>. This is a style of application design which
co-locates query processing with application design and uses a log
of changes as the primary store for the application.</li>
<li><em>Journaling for high-availability</em>. A process that does local
computation can be made fault-tolerant by logging out changes that
it makes to its local state so another process can reload these
changes and carry on if it should fail. A concrete example of this
is handling counts, aggregations, and other &quot;group by&quot;-like
processing in a stream query system. Samza, a real-time
stream-processing framework,
<a href="http://samza.apache.org/learn/documentation/0.7.0/container/state-management.html">uses this feature</a>
for exactly this purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>In each of these cases one needs primarily to handle the real-time feed
of changes, but occasionally, when a machine crashes or data needs to be
re-loaded or re-processed, one needs to do a full load. Log compaction
allows feeding both of these use cases off the same backing topic. This
style of usage of a log is described in more detail in
<a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The general idea is quite simple. If we had infinite log retention, and
we logged each change in the above cases, then we would have captured
the state of the system at each time from when it first began. Using
this complete log, we could restore to any point in time by replaying
the first N records in the log. This hypothetical complete log is not
very practical for systems that update a single record many times as the
log will grow without bound even for a stable dataset. The simple log
retention mechanism which throws away old updates will bound space but
the log is no longer a way to restore the current state&mdash;now restoring
from the beginning of the log no longer recreates the current state as
old updates may not be captured at all.</p>
<p>Log compaction is a mechanism to give finer-grained per-record
retention, rather than the coarser-grained time-based retention. The
idea is to selectively remove records where we have a more recent update
with the same primary key. This way the log is guaranteed to have at
least the last state for each key.</p>
<p>This retention policy can be set per-topic, so a single cluster can have
some topics where retention is enforced by size or time and other topics
where retention is enforced by compaction.</p>
<p>This functionality is inspired by one of LinkedIn's oldest and most
successful pieces of infrastructure&mdash;a database changelog caching
service called <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/databus">Databus</a>. Unlike
most log-structured storage systems Kafka is built for subscription and
organizes data for fast linear reads and writes. Unlike Databus, Kafka
acts as a source-of-truth store so it is useful even in situations where
the upstream data source would not otherwise be replayable.</p>
<h3 id="design_compactionbasics">
  Log Compaction Basics
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_compactionbasics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here is a high-level picture that shows the logical structure of a Kafka
log with the offset for each message.</p>
<p><img src="/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/images/log_cleaner_anatomy.png" alt="" />{.centered}</p>
<p>The head of the log is identical to a traditional Kafka log. It has
dense, sequential offsets and retains all messages. Log compaction adds
an option for handling the tail of the log. The picture above shows a
log with a compacted tail. Note that the messages in the tail of the log
retain the original offset assigned when they were first written&mdash;that
never changes. Note also that all offsets remain valid positions in the
log, even if the message with that offset has been compacted away; in
this case this position is indistinguishable from the next highest
offset that does appear in the log. For example, in the picture above
the offsets 36, 37, and 38 are all equivalent positions and a read
beginning at any of these offsets would return a message set beginning
with 38.</p>
<p>Compaction also allows for deletes. A message with a key and a null
payload will be treated as a delete from the log. Such a record is
sometimes referred to as a <em>tombstone</em>. This delete marker will cause
any prior message with that key to be removed (as would any new message
with that key), but delete markers are special in that they will
themselves be cleaned out of the log after a period of time to free up
space. The point in time at which deletes are no longer retained is
marked as the &quot;delete retention point&quot; in the above diagram.</p>
<p>The compaction is done in the background by periodically recopying log
segments. Cleaning does not block reads and can be throttled to use no
more than a configurable amount of I/O throughput to avoid impacting
producers and consumers. The actual process of compacting a log segment
looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/images/log_compaction.png" alt="" />{.centered}</p>
<h3 id="design_compactionguarantees">
  What guarantees does log compaction provide
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_compactionguarantees">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Log compaction guarantees the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any consumer that stays caught-up to within the head of the log will
see every message that is written; these messages will have
sequential offsets. The topic's <code>min.compaction.lag.ms</code> can be used
to guarantee the minimum length of time must pass after a message is
written before it could be compacted. I.e. it provides a lower bound
on how long each message will remain in the (uncompacted) head. The
topic's <code>max.compaction.lag.ms</code> can be used to guarantee the
maximum delay between the time a message is written and the time the
message becomes eligible for compaction.</li>
<li>Ordering of messages is always maintained. Compaction will never
re-order messages, just remove some.</li>
<li>The offset for a message never changes. It is the permanent
identifier for a position in the log.</li>
<li>Any consumer progressing from the start of the log will see at least
the final state of all records in the order they were written.
Additionally, all delete markers for deleted records will be seen,
provided the consumer reaches the head of the log in a time period
less than the topic's <code>delete.retention.ms</code> setting (the default is
24 hours). In other words: since the removal of delete markers
happens concurrently with reads, it is possible for a consumer to
miss delete markers if it lags by more than <code>delete.retention.ms</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="design_compactiondetails">
  Log Compaction Details
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_compactiondetails">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Log compaction is handled by the log cleaner, a pool of background
threads that recopy log segment files, removing records whose key
appears in the head of the log. Each compactor thread works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>It chooses the log that has the highest ratio of log head to log
tail</li>
<li>It creates a succinct summary of the last offset for each key in the
head of the log</li>
<li>It recopies the log from beginning to end removing keys which have a
later occurrence in the log. New, clean segments are swapped into
the log immediately so the additional disk space required is just
one additional log segment (not a fully copy of the log).</li>
<li>The summary of the log head is essentially just a space-compact hash
table. It uses exactly 24 bytes per entry. As a result with 8GB of
cleaner buffer one cleaner iteration can clean around 366GB of log
head (assuming 1k messages).</li>

users chosen by the broker using a configurable <code>PrincipalBuilder</code>.
Client-id is a logical grouping of clients with a meaningful name chosen
by the client application. The tuple (user, client-id) defines a secure
logical group of clients that share both user principal and client-id.</p>
<p>Quotas can be applied to (user, client-id), user or client-id groups.
For a given connection, the most specific quota matching the connection
is applied. All connections of a quota group share the quota configured
for the group. For example, if (user=&quot;test-user&quot;,
client-id=&quot;test-client&quot;) has a produce quota of 10MB/sec, this is
shared across all producer instances of user &quot;test-user&quot; with the
client-id &quot;test-client&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="design_quotasconfig">
  Quota Configuration
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_quotasconfig">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Quota configuration may be defined for (user, client-id), user and
client-id groups. It is possible to override the default quota at any of
the quota levels that needs a higher (or even lower) quota. The
mechanism is similar to the per-topic log config overrides. User and
(user, client-id) quota overrides are written to ZooKeeper under
<em><strong>/config/users</strong></em> and client-id quota overrides are written under
<em><strong>/config/clients</strong></em>. These overrides are read by all brokers and are
effective immediately. This lets us change quotas without having to do a
rolling restart of the entire cluster. See <a href="#quotas">here</a> for details.
Default quotas for each group may also be updated dynamically using the
same mechanism.</p>
<p>The order of precedence for quota configuration is:</p>
<ol>
<li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
<li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
<li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;</li>
<li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
<li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
<li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;</li>
<li>/config/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
<li>/config/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="design_quotasbandwidth">
  Network Bandwidth Quotas
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_quotasbandwidth">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Network bandwidth quotas are defined as the byte rate threshold for each
group of clients sharing a quota. By default, each unique client group
receives a fixed quota in bytes/sec as configured by the cluster. This
quota is defined on a per-broker basis. Each group of clients can
publish/fetch a maximum of X bytes/sec per broker before clients are
throttled.</p>
<h3 id="design_quotascpu">
  Request Rate Quotas
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_quotascpu">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Request rate quotas are defined as the percentage of time a client can
utilize on request handler I/O threads and network threads of each
broker within a quota window. A quota of <code>n%</code> represents <code>n%</code> of one
thread, so the quota is out of a total capacity of
<code>((num.io.threads + num.network.threads) * 100)%</code>. Each group of clients
may use a total percentage of upto <code>n%</code> across all I/O and network
threads in a quota window before being throttled. Since the number of
threads allocated for I/O and network threads are typically based on the
number of cores available on the broker host, request rate quotas
represent the total percentage of CPU that may be used by each group of
clients sharing the quota.</p>
<h3 id="design_quotasenforcement">
  Enforcement
  <a class="anchor" href="#design_quotasenforcement">#</a>
</h3>
<p>By default, each unique client group receives a fixed quota as
configured by the cluster. This quota is defined on a per-broker basis.
Each client can utilize this quota per broker before it gets throttled.
We decided that defining these quotas per broker is much better than
having a fixed cluster wide bandwidth per client because that would
require a mechanism to share client quota usage among all the brokers.
This can be harder to get right than the quota implementation itself!</p>
<p>How does a broker react when it detects a quota violation? In our
solution, the broker first computes the amount of delay needed to bring
the violating client under its quota and returns a response with the
delay immediately. In case of a fetch request, the response will not
contain any data. Then, the broker mutes the channel to the client, not
to process requests from the client anymore, until the delay is over.
Upon receiving a response with a non-zero delay duration, the Kafka
client will also refrain from sending further requests to the broker
during the delay. Therefore, requests from a throttled client are
effectively blocked from both sides. Even with older client
implementations that do not respect the delay response from the broker,
the back pressure applied by the broker via muting its socket channel
can still handle the throttling of badly behaving clients. Those clients
who sent further requests to the throttled channel will receive
responses only after the delay is over.</p>
<p>Byte-rate and thread utilization are measured over multiple small
windows (e.g. 30 windows of 1 second each) in order to detect and
correct quota violations quickly. Typically, having large measurement
windows (for e.g. 10 windows of 30 seconds each) leads to large bursts
of traffic followed by long delays which is not great in terms of user
experience.</p>
